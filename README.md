###Hello!

Here, I used IMDB movie reviews (50,000 records), removed the stop words, stemmed it, TFIDF'ed it and then finally put it
into a Naive-Bayes Classifier to classify the positive and negative sentiments!

Data Source: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/

Do tell me how I can make it better! :D
